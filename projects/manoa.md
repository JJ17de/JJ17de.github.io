## Overview 
The "Foodie Finders" website is designed to cater to the needs of UH Manoa students and faculty, providing them with the opportunity to discover and evaluate the diverse range of dining choices offered on campus. The website offers various search options for students and faculty to easily find food vendors based on ratings, operational hours, or overall popularity. One notable aspect is the 'Whats Hot' section, where the Trending restaurants are showcased.

Users can comment and rate restaurants however must first create their own accounts. Once registered, they have the ability to share their thoughts on restaurants they have visited. However, there is a limitation of one review per restaurant. Users can easily edit or remove their reviews.

For vendors, when they sign up they are required to provide detailed information about their restaurants, which they have the flexibility to edit or remove as necessary. Once registered, they can freely update their page and details about their reseratunt as well as highlight their their services with detailed descriptions, operating hours, and images.
