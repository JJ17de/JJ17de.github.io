I made a 2-player Air Hockey game using Java, which is a simple programming language, and built it in Eclipse, a tool that helps to write and organize code. The game looks like a real air hockey table with paddles and a puck that players move around. I worked hard to make sure the puck moves smoothly and that when it hits the paddles or the edges of the table, it acts like it would in real life. 

Making the game work for two players at the same time was tricky. Both players can play on the same computer without any delay. I also added a way to keep track of the score. This project was fun and helped me learn a lot about making games in Java and using Eclipse.
