  Writing code in software development is a lot like solving a hard puzzle. As a system grows, changes, and is strong, all of its code must work perfectly with each other. In the same way that ancient craftsmen kept trade secrets secret, software writers use "design patterns." 
  It is well known that design patterns can help with common problems that come up when making software. They help writers make software that works well and is easy to keep up to date. With these patterns, coders don't have to waste time coming up with new ways to solve problems that have already been solved. This makes their code simpler to understand and use. 
  I first learned about design patterns when I was in charge of a big software project with many smaller ones that worked together. The Observer style is what I like best. Objects can talk to each other while still being separate. To give you an example, this helped me create a way for changes made to one object to be sent to other objects that needed to know about the changes. It made it easier to make more changes, like adding new parts to a machine without having to rebuild it from scratch. 
  For each job, I needed an analytics tool that could show different types of data on the fly. Along with the game plan, this worked great. Changing apps is easy, like changing the filters on a camera to get different views. The code was easier to understand and more adaptable, so it could work with new types of data without having to change how things were set up before. 
  These events taught me how important design rules are when writing code. They make it easier for writers to work together by giving them a common language to use. They also make code more flexible and reusable, which is very important in the fast-changing IT field of today.
